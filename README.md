# Loyalty Program with Fungible Tokens

## About

This project serves as an example of a loyalty program with fungible tokens.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a [current version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) installed â€“ we are targeting versions `16+`.

Read about other [prerequisites](https://docs.near.org/develop/prerequisites) in our docs.

### Installation


Install all dependencies:

    npm install


Build your contract:

    npm run build


Deploy your contract to TestNet with a temporary dev account:

    npm run deploy


Usage
=====

Put the merchant name without the network suffix in the `.env.local` file 
in the `frontend` folder (see `frontend/.env.local.exmaple` file). Here is an example for a merchant account `awesome-merchant.testnet`:

  MERCHANT_ID=awesome-merchant

Start your frontend:

    npm run build:web & npm start

Test your contract:

    npm test

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The smart-contract code lives in the `/contracts` folder.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/frontend` folder. `/frontend/index.html` is a great
   place to start exploring. Note that it loads in `/frontend/index.js`,
   this is your entrypoint to learn how the frontend connects to the NEAR blockchain.
3. There is a backend code in the `backend.js` file in the `frontend` directory. This code
   simulates a web2 backend.
4. Test your contract: `npm test`, this will run the tests in `integration-tests` directory.
